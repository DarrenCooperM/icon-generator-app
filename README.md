# Logo-Generator App

This is a full stack app using the T3 stack and deployed with AWS Amplify that allows the user to generate icons in seconds!

# Description

This is a personal project with a genuine interest to integrate AI into an application. Because the AI isn't free to use, Stripe payments have also been integrated via [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs) and google authentication.

The user is able to login using their gmail account and buy credits with Stripe Integration and start generating high quality logos by typing in the prompt and selecting the following options.

The data and generated logos from the user are stored in Supabase. Additionally, the designs generated overall are stored on the S3 bucket on AWS.

The logos are able to be uniquely generated by the DALLE API integration.
